# Wanna contribute?

Welcome to our happy country of Lambdarest!

Lambdarest is heavily created in collaboration and we value all contributions.

## Are you having issues?
Create issues or pull requests, no real guidelines given here.

If you feel like it, take a look around and see if the issue was posted before, but if not, thats ok too!

## Have you made a PR?

A maintainer will review and take care of version bumping and release etc.

I am sure we can all work together and get your work released!

By the way: We use `pip install black` for linting :-)
